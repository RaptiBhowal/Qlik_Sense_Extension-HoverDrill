Qlik Sense Extension - Hover Drill Bar Chart
================================================================================
This extension allows a user to drill between two dimensions in a bar chart by hovering across the axis, as opposed to clicking to filter the data.

An example QVF is included that demonstrates the extension with a random data set.
